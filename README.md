## Description

This assignment on code refactoring is to show what I've learned when it comes to HTML and CSS. 
The starter HTML code I was given had some issues with readability and semantic tags.
Along with a broken link in the header due to a missing ID, I have corrected them to the best of my abilities to demonstrate what I've learned in the first week of the UCD coding bootcamp. 
The CSS has been consolidated and tagged with appropriate comments for future readers to be able to quickly see what stylings affect which elements.
